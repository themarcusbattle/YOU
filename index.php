	<h3>How to manage You</h3>
	<ol>	
		<li>Define the places you frequent (May be physical or mental)</li>
		<li>Define who you are in these places (Husband, Web Dev, Elder, Programmer) This changes at times</li>
		<li>Define any specific projects you're working on there (Campus Visits, Build Car)</li>
		<li>Define those loose ends that always come up and disrupt your projects. This can be defined by a superior or relative to your perspective <i>aka assumed roles</i> (washing the car, doing the laundry, answering the phone, paying the bills)</li>
	</ol>
	<h4>Notes</h4>
	<p>Please note that you operate differently in all of these places</p>
	<p>Who you are and what you do is different at times</p>
	<p>Somethings you do are definite, with an actual end date. Others are ongoing, such as washing a car or maintaining a website. It's these ongoing projects that build and seem to consume us, because we don't know how to give them definition.</p>
	<p>There are those unique times in your life, when a project you have poured into will become a "place" - a world separate from any other.</p>
	<p>It's possible that an area of your life that has no recent project or ongoing tasks, is not getting the attention it deserves. Or it you deem that it deserves no attention, then that place has become irrelivant.</p>
	<p><span class="label label-success">Suggestion</span> To bring structure to your life and redeem time, attempt to automate areas in the "Ongoing" category. Find unique ways to delegate, or save time with these areas.</p>
	<p><span class="label label-success">Suggestion</span> Clarify your biggest hurdles in the "Ongoing" section. This can be the start of you proactively processing and clearing the stress of this area.</p>
	<p><span class="label label-info">Note</span> Ongoing items are often sent as urgent, ASAP or before the day is out. Projects are important because without your skillset beign applied to it, the project won't get completed in a timely manner. Projects have a definite end so take time and complete them. Deferentiating between ongoing and projects is the art of learning what's important versus what's urgent.</p>
	<p>Give your life definition with <strong>Project You</strong></p>

	<h4>Notes</h4>
	<p><span class="label label-success">Suggestion</span> Make a list of "Helpers" - people in your life who can possibly bear the brunt of what you're working on. It can be a spouse, parent, child or good friend who "always has your back". Figure out unique ways to incorporate their love and support into what you're working on. This is especially important for married couples whose time may be spent too much apart from each other.</p>
	<p>For the task that can wait to "later", flag them as such. The system will create a new project out of all of your "wait" tasks. It should be flagged as such if you realize (1) it will delay you from the deadline (2) It does not provide immediate importance to the project</p>
	<p><span class="label label-success">Suggestion</span> Remain flexible, but be stern in communicating importance. Things will come to distract you from what you have defined here. Fight to keep items in their position as important. If you are presented with something that has been overlooked, consider adding it and then flagging with "wait" so that it get's proper focus on version +1 of that project.</p>
	<p><span class="label">Note</span> When you begin to organize you, you will notice that some things like work are necessary but don't seem to provide any added value to your life outside of money. Don't be discouraged by this. Take a moment and figure out the immaterial benefits of working this job. If after evaluating you are still left unfulfilled, you might want to begin to shift your focus. You can always accept that this is apart of your life and that it even though it is a necessary evil, this process of organizing can provide major benefits to help you enjoy this "place".</p>
	<p>Evaluate what is needed to complete each task for a project</p>
	<p>It's important that before you begin, you research similar successfully completed projects. This is so you can ensure you're not repeating the same mistakes and also get a good estimate of counting the cost. Finding out how long it took them is very beneficial. Dare to even contact them and ask them.</p>
	<p>Dont't abandon notebooks, napkins, hands or anything else sensory that helps you draft your ideas</p>
	<p><strong>Allow users to list out how it will behave.</strong></p>
